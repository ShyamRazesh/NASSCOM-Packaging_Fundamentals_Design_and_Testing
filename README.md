# NASSCOM-Packaging_Fundamentals_Design_and_Testing
This workshop bridges the gap between chip design and modern packaging. This course of the workshop will explore advanced interconnects, thermal simulation, assembly processes, and the evolution of packaging technologies, gaining the skills to select the right system-level packaging solutions.

# Workshop Overview

The Packaging Fundamentals of Design and Technology Workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to the rapidly evolving field of semiconductor packaging. It equips participants with a strong foundation in modern packaging principles and their impact on system-level performance. The workshop explores the evolution of packaging technologies, highlighting key transitions from traditional methods to advanced, high-density integration techniques. Learners gain exposure to cutting-edge interconnect solutions, including 2.5D, 3D, and advanced substrate architectures.  

The program also covers essential topics such as thermal behaviour, heat-spreading strategies, and simulation methods for predicting reliability. Participants are guided through assembly flows, materials selection, and process considerations that influence yield and performance. The course emphasises real-world decision-making when choosing optimal packaging solutions for various applications. Through practical insights and conceptual understanding, attendees develop the ability to evaluate trade-offs in cost, performance, form factor, and manufacturability. Designed for engineers, students, and professionals, the workshop builds confidence in navigating the complexities of next-generation semiconductor packaging.
